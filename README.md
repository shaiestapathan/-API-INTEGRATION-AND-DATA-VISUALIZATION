DESCRIPTION:

In Task 1 of the CodTech Python Internship, we had to use a public API with Python and show the data using graphs. The goal was to learn how APIs work, how to get data from the internet, and how to show that data in a nice and easy way.

âœ… What I Did
I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get real-time weather data of any city.
I made a beautiful Tkinter app where users can type a city name and get:
ðŸŒ¡ Temperature
ðŸ’§ Humidity
âš™ Pressure
ðŸŒ¬ Wind Speed
ðŸŒ¥ Weather Condition
ðŸŒ… Sunrise & Sunset Time
â›… Weather Icon
ðŸ“Š Data Visualization

I used Matplotlib to create a bar chart that shows:
Temperature (Â°C)
Humidity (%)
Pressure (hPa)
The chart uses different colors and looks clean on a dark background.

ðŸŽ¨ GUI Features
A modern dark theme with rounded boxes and smooth layout
A search bar to type city name
A cute loading animation while data is being fetched
Error messages if the city is wrong or internet is not working
The app updates live data with time and weather icon

ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
How to use an API with Python
How to read and use JSON data
How to create charts with Matplotlib
How to make an interactive app using Tkinter
How to handle user input and errors

This task helped me improve my Python skills and understand how to turn real-world data into something useful and beautiful. It was a fun and practical project!
